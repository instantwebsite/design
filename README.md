# Instant Websites Design
> Everything related to design/UI/UX in Instant Website

Welcome to the Design repository of Instant Website.

Here we practice participatory, inclusive and open design. What does this mean in practice? It means that anyone can get involed in any steps of our design process.

We currently keep track of open tasks in our [TaskBoard](https://github.com/instantwebsite/design/projects/1)


## TaskBoard

The [TaskBoard](https://github.com/instantwebsite/design/projects/1) is for keeping track of what we're currently working on, who is doing what and at what stage a task is currently at. 

Current columns and their meaning:

- **Problem Scoping** - We have figured out that we want to solve something. At this stage, we try to nail down exactly what needs solving (including what doesn't need solving) and try to outline it as well as we can
- **Requirements Gathering** - The problem has been properly identified, now we can start thinking about what requirements needs to be fulfilled in order to solve that specific problem.
- **Design** - A task moves to this column once it's ready to start being designed. If a task is not assigned to someone here, it's up for grabs for anyone to self-assign and start working on.
- **Feedback** - Once the design is ready to be reviewed and no more design is currently needed, a task goes into this column. Once here we leave feedback on the work done and try to iterate until the design is as good as it can be
- **Implementation** - If there is any work needed for implementing the design, it will be done at this stage
- **Completed** - As the column says, everything is done
